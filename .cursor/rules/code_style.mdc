- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` in JavaScript.
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces). For this project, let's aim for 2 spaces.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
- Keep functions focused on a single task.
- Ensure HTML is well-structured and semantic.
- CSS classes should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., BEM or a simpler hyphenated style).
- Avoid overly long lines of code.
